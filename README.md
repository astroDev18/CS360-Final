# CS360-Final

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

My app was built to allow the user to handle CRUD functionality in their personal database that is linked to their account. They can use this database for any real world modeling, like a stock app or 	a grocery list.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

In total I made a login, registration, homescreen, edit screen, and delete screen. I planned out the usability of my app step by step. I kept them simple and easy to use. I also used pop ups for confirmation on the delete screen and a pop up that asked the user to input a new value for the edit screen. 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

As I built my app I broke down my requirements and started from the beginning, which was the login/registration pages. Then I built out the app as needed to continue to grow it into a working application. This can also help me in the future as I can approach a large task and break it down to accomplish it in a structured manner.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by approaching it as a user and testing out each functionality to see if it was working properly. This helped me be certain everything is working as I confirmed it by pretending to be a user and it was functional.
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate for database integration as it was new to me and I had trouble linking it with my android app. I was able to overcome this through learning from the SQLLite documentation.
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I managed to create the home screen CRUD page very well in my opinion. It showcases my ability to handle all 4 functionalities and handle pop ups. I created easy to use pop ups that allow the user to confirm their actions.
